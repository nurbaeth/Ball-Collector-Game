# Ball Collector Game

This is a simple and fun ball collecting game made with Python and Pygame. The goal of the game is to control a bouncing ball and collect items that randomly appear on the screen to earn points. The ball bounces off the walls, and the game continues until the player decides to quit.

## Features:
- Ball control with arrow keys.
- Randomly appearing objects to collect for points.
- Ball bounces off the screen borders.
- Score tracking.

## How to Play:
1. Use the arrow keys to move the ball around the screen.
2. Collect the green items that appear on the screen to increase your score.
3. Avoid obstacles (if any) that might appear as the game progresses. 
4. The game will display your score in the top left corner.
